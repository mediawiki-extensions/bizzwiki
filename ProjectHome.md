**NOTE**: I am no longer actively developing this project.

The target of this project is to enhance the base Mediawiki platform in order to make it 'business grade'.

In short, theses are the top level areas of concern:

- Access Control

- Availability  (in simple configurations)

- Manageability  (remotely through WEB interface)

See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BizzWiki for additional information.
